## Introduction

FinCube addresses the inefficiencies of the current financial system, which heavily relies on centralized authorities like Central Banks and systems like SWIFT. By utilizing blockchain technology and decentralized governance through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), FinCube enables near-instantaneous transactions, reduced costs, and enhanced security.

## Features

- **Decentralization**: Eliminates single points of failure and ensures continuous operation.
- **Faster Transactions**: Processes transactions almost instantaneously.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Lower transaction fees managed and set by the DAO.
- **Transparency and Trust**: Public ledger for all transactions.
- **Compliance and Security**: Built-in compliance with regulatory requirements and enhanced security through cryptography.
- **Flexibility and Scalability**: Easily adaptable to new market requirements and scalable to include new MFS members.
- **Inclusive Governance**: Democratic decision-making process through the DAO.
- **Economic Inclusivity**: Enhances financial inclusivity in underdeveloped and developing countries.


## Technical Features
| Features             | Technology Used         | Remarks                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Containerization     | Docker                  | Docker is used to containerize services                                                  |
| Message Queue        | RabbitMQ                | There are multiple services which need to communicate with each other at the same time. Some of them may not be active at the same time. So for interservice communication, Message Queue is used |
| Blockchain Indexer   | The Graph               | Used to listen and query events from the blockchain                                      |
| Proxy Contract       | UUPSUpgradeableProxy    | The smart contract is made UUPS upgradeable to incorporate changes on the go             |
| Pagination           | Solidity                | Pagination is a way for a caller to make multiple smaller requests to retrieve the data. To prevent read function from being overflowed, pagination is used |
| API Gateway           |   ExpressJS            | Redirecting client request to appropriate backend container |

## Architecture

FinCube leverages a combination of blockchain technology, smart contracts, and decentralized governance to create a robust and scalable financial platform. Key components include:

- **Blockchain Ledger**: For recording immutable transaction records.
- **Smart Contracts**: To automate and enforce transaction rules.
- **DAO Governance**: Ensuring democratic decision-making and policy setting.
- **Web3 Integration**: For seamless on-ramping and off-ramping of digital assets.
